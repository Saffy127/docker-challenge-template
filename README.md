# Docker Challenges Compilation

## Overview

This repository holds the results and learnings from a series of Docker challenges that are designed to enhance understanding of containerization concepts and practical Docker skills.

## Challenge 1 - Static Web Server with Docker

Learnt to containerize a static web page using Docker and NGINX, making it accessible on a local host.

Key Concepts:
- Writing a `Dockerfile`
- Building a Docker image
- Running a Docker container

## Challenge 2 - Dynamic Application with Docker

Built upon the first challenge to run a dynamic Node.js application within a Docker container.

Key Concepts:
- Setting up Docker Compose
- Containerizing a Node.js application
- Using NGINX as a reverse proxy

## Challenge 3 - Full Stack Application with Database Integration

Integrated a MySQL database with the application using Docker Compose.

Key Concepts:
- Multi-container orchestration with Docker Compose
- Environment variables and .env files for configuration
- Persistent data with Docker volumes

## Challenge 4 - Scaling Up an Application

Scaled the application from one to three instances to understand the benefits of load balancing and horizontal scaling.

Key Concepts:
- Scaling services with Docker Compose
- Load balancing with NGINX
- Managing port conflicts

## Learnings

Through these challenges, I've gained a solid understanding of Docker fundamentals, container orchestration, and service scaling. I've also come to appreciate the ease with which Docker and Docker Compose enable the deployment of complex multi-container applications.
